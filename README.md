Meet Shy Guy. He's a puppet able to perform a simple emotional arch in collaboration with a human scene-partner. Using an infrared sensor, a micro-servo, and Arduino, Shy Guy acts out three emotional states in reaction to the proximity of his human's hand to his sensor: Fear, Curiosity, and Affection.
